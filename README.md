# Say-Hello-World
This is my first time on github
I worked for DEC a long time ago. That was before the PC time started. With the integration of the PC's into the VAX / VMS world everything changed.
So I have increasingly looked after the PC world. In addition, there were the customer-specific programs that I was able to implement with Visual Basic.
At the moment I want to learn more about Python, but I'm still at the beginning. Please understand a newbe like me!
